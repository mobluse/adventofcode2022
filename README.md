# Advent of Code 2022
Some of my solutions in [Snek](https://sneklang.org/), but they should also work in Python. I have modified the input files by adding a last 
line with a single dot '.', because I read the files using `input()` and Snek doesn't have exceptions.

You get the input data from https://adventofcode.com/.

I installed Snek in Debian Bullseye Linux by cloning Lola, compiling with `make`, and installing with `sudo make install`, and then installing the
dependencies except `lola`. Then cloning `snek`, compiling from `~/snek/ports/posix/` with `make`, and installing with `sudo make install`.
